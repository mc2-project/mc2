Configuration
=============

Before using MC\ :sup:`2` Client, you should configure it by filling out two YAML files. One YAML file is for MC\ :sup:`2` Client global configuration. The other is for Azure resource configuration -- specifying your keys for authentication, filling out names of resources you want to create, etc.
