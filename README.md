![MC2 Overview](docs/img/mc2_workflow.jpeg)

Born out of research in the [UC Berkeley RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/), MC<sup>2</sup> is a platform for running secure analytics and machine learning on encrypted data.
With MC<sup>2</sup>, users can outsource their confidential data workloads to the cloud, while ensuring that the data is never exposed unencrypted to the cloud provider. 
MC<sup>2</sup> also enables secure collaboration -- multiple data owners can use the platform to jointly analyze their collective data, without revealing their individual data to each other.

MC<sup>2</sup> provides the following (actively maintained) secure computation services:
* [Opaque SQL](https://github.com/mc2-project/opaque-sql): Encrypted data analytics on Spark SQL using hardware enclaves
* [Secure XGBoost](https://github.com/mc2-project/secure-xgboost): Collaborative XGBoost training and inference on encrypted data using hardware enclaves
* [Federated XGBoost](https://github.com/mc2-project/federated-xgboost): Collaborative XGBoost in the federated setting

The MC<sup>2</sup> project also includes exploratory research prototypes that develop new cryptographic techniques for secure computation. Please visit the individual project pages for more information:
* [Cerebro](https://github.com/mc2-project/cerebro): A general purpose Python DSL for learning with secure multiparty computation.
* [Delphi](https://github.com/mc2-project/delphi): Secure inference for deep neural networks.

This repository contains the source code for the **MC<sup>2</sup> client**, which enables users to easily interface with MC<sup>2</sup> services deployed remotely in the cloud. Currently, the client supports remote deployments of Opaque SQL only. Support for Secure XGBoost is coming soon.
To run an end-to-end MC<sup>2</sup> workflow:
1. Launch Opaque SQL in the cloud (instructions to do so can be found in the respective repositories) 
2. Use the MC<sup>2</sup> client to encrypt data locally, transfer it to the cloud VMs, run scripts specifying the desired computation, and retrieve and view encrypted results.

## Installation
To quickly play with MC<sup>2</sup> Client and Opaque SQL, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a container (takes ~7 min) with all MC<sup>2</sup> Client and Opaque SQL dependencies. To do so, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

The container will have the contents of this `mc2` directory at `/mc2/client`, and Opaque SQL will be at `/mc2/opaque-sql`

For ease of use, we recommend that you create a directory within your host `mc2` directory that will serve as your playground, and then mount your `playground` directory to the Docker container. Mounting will ensure that changes you make in your `playground` directory outside the container will be reflected inside the container, and vice versa. If you're bringing your own data, you can either copy your data over to your playground directory, or separately mount your data directory to the container.

```sh
# Clone the `mc2-project/mc2 repo`
# Build a Docker image called `mc2_img`
docker build -t mc2_img .

# Run the container, mounting your playground to the container, and open a shell into the container
docker run -it -v </absolute/path/to/mc2/playground>:/mc2/client/playground mc2_img /bin/bash
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to install MC<sup>2</sup> Client directly on your host, follow [these instructions](https://mc2-project.github.io/mc2/install.html).

## Quickstart
This quickstart will give you a flavor of using MC<sup>2</sup> with Opaque SQL, and can be entirely done locally with Docker if desired. You will use MC<sup>2</sup> Client to encrypt some data, transfer the encrypted data to a remote machine, run an Opaque SQL job on the encrypted data on the remote machine, and retrieve and decrypt the job's encrypted results. To run everything securely, you can choose to spin up Opaque SQL on Azure VMs with SGX-support. Alternatively, to get a flavor of MC<sup>2</sup> without having to use Azure, you can use the deployment of Opaque SQL in the Docker container.

MC<sup>2</sup> Client provides a command line interface that enables you to remotely interact with MC<sup>2</sup> compute services. The CLI relies on a configuration file that you should modify before each step in this quickstart to tell MC<sup>2</sup> Client what exactly you want to do. An example of the configuration file is [here](demo/config.yaml).

### Docker Quickstart
If you'd like to try everything out locally, you can do so within the Docker container you built in the [installation](#installation) section.

1. Copy the contents of the `quickstart` directory to your mounted "playground" directory to ensure that your changes inside the container get reflected on your host. Then, set the `MC2_CONFIG` environment variable to the path of your configuration file.

    ```sh
    # From the /mc2/client directory
    cp -r quickstart/* playground
    export MC2_CONFIG=</path/to/playground/config.yaml>
    ```

1. Optionally, generate a keypair and a symmetric key that MC<sup>2</sup> Client will use to encrypt your data. Specify your username and output paths in the `user` section of the configuration file. Then, generate the keys.

    ```sh
    mc2 init
    ```

1. Start the Opaque SQL compute service.
    
    ```sh
    mc2 start
    ```

1. Prepare your data for computation by encrypting and uploading it. Note that "uploading" here means copying because we have a local deployment.

    ```sh
    mc2 upload
    ```

1. Run the provided Opaque SQL quickstart script, to be executed by MC<sup>2</sup>. The script can be found [here](quickstart/opaque_sql_demo.scala). 

    ```sh
    mc2 run
    ```

1. Once computation has finished, you can retrieve your encrypted results and decrypt them. Specify the results' path and their encryption format in the `download` section of configuration. The decrypted results will be in the same directory.

    ```sh
    mc2 download
    ```

### Azure Quickstart
You can also choose to run this quickstart with enclave-enabled VMs on the cloud with Azure Confidential Computing. This guide will take you through launching such VMs and using them with MC<sup>2</sup>.

1. In the container, copy the contents of the `quickstart` directory to your mounted "playground" directory to ensure that your changes inside the container get reflected on your host. Otherwise, no need to do anything. Then, set the `MC2_CONFIG` environment variable to the path of your configuration file.

    ```sh
    # From the /mc2/client directory
    cp -r quickstart/* playground
    export MC2_CONFIG=</path/to/playground/config.yaml>
    ```

1. Optionally, generate a keypair and a symmetric key that MC<sup>2</sup> Client will use to encrypt your data. Specify your username and output paths in the `user` section of the configuration file. Then, generate the keys.

    ```sh
    mc2 init
    ```

1. Next, launch the machines and resources you'll be using for computation. MC<sup>2</sup> Client provides an interface to launch resources on Azure (and sets up the machines with necessary dependencies). Take a look at the `launch` section of the configuration file -- you'll need to specify the path to your [Azure configuration file](quickstart/azure.yaml), which is a YAML file that details the names and types of various resources you will launch. 

    Next, log in to Azure through the command line and set your subscription ID. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/setup-azure-subscription-how-to?tabs=portal) are instructions on how to find your subscription ID.

    ```sh
    az login
    az account set -s <YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
    ```
    Once you've done that, launch the resources.

    ```sh
    mc2 launch
    ```

1. Start the Opaque SQL compute service. 
    
    ```sh
    mc2 start
    ```

1. Prepare your data for computation by encrypting and uploading it.

    ```sh
    mc2 upload
    ```

1. Run the provided Opaque SQL demo script, to be executed by MC<sup>2</sup>. The script can be found [here](quickstart/opaque_sql_demo.scala). All paths in the script are remote paths, since the script will be executing on the remote Opaque SQL service. Then, go to the `run` section of the configuration and specify the path to your script, as well as parameters for remote attestation. Run the following command to remotely start computation.  

    ```sh
    mc2 run
    ```

1. Once computation has finished, you can retrieve your encrypted results and decrypt them.

    ```sh
    mc2 download
    ```

1. Once you've finished using your Azure resources, you can use MC<sup>2</sup> Client to terminate them. You can specify which resources to terminate in the `teardown` section of the configuration.
    
    ```sh
    mc2 teardown
    ```
